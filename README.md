# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
As a new employee at PyBer, we were tasked with analyzing ride share data from January to early May of 2019 and creating a presentation for the CEO. This analysis will help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. In this summary, we are looking at ride-share data by city type: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. 

## Results

### Data Frame

Once the two data sets provided were merged, we were able to analyze the difference in data between city types. Urban type cities resulted in the largest count of total rides, while rural cities have the lowest count of total rides. This information is not surprising, since urban areas are normally more heavily populated. 

In urban cities, the total rides is less than the total amount of drivers. In urban cities, there were 1,625 total rides but 2,405 drivers. There were over 1,000 drivers who did not work within this timeframe. 

Suburban and Rural areas produced similar results. The number of rides were much lower than Urban cities. Since there is less demand for ride-shares, the cost of each ride increases while the need for additional drivers decreases. 

### Fare Summary

From the Data Frame above, we were able to take the data and produce a line chart grouped by weeks to show the total fares by city types. 

All three city types follow a same pattern. We see increases and decreases in similar ways throughout the months.
In February, all the cities see a peak in their sum of fares. 
Suburban cities see the most drastic drop in fares after their peak, but seem to have climb in fares towards the middle of April.

## Summary

1. PyBer might consider putting a cap on the number of drivers in Urban cities. The number of drivers in urban areas is about a 1,000 over the total amount of rides given from Jan-May. The demand for rides in urban areas is high, but not sustainable for almost double the amount of drivers vs rides given. 

2. The time that each ride was taken should be taken into consideration. If there are peak time frames when the most rides are requested/ taken, PyBer might consider putting in place a "sure charge" during peak times. This could also increase the "average fare per driver".

3. PyBer should do a direct analysis on the cost per mile. If the data is analyzed a milage basis we might be able to see where extra resources could be directed and what city type is making the biggest impact.
